Bindiya started working at the young age of 21, where she was in the business of exporting sheet glass. This was then predominantly a male domain, but she became one of the very few women who undertook the work with equal tact and finesse, if not better. Later on she added a travel agency to her profile.This is when she started following her passion for travel. By mixing her love for travelling with her skill of handling business, she created nothing but phenomenal success.</p>

<h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>VISION</h2>
<p style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>What started off as a day-to-day kitchen project is now a well established enterprise and growing rapidly. In a very short span Herbal Me has made a very strong foothold in&nbsp;supplying cosmetics to North American,&nbsp;European, South Asian and Middle Eastern markets. We have an ever expanding audience, which motivates us to do better, innovate and diversify, into other categories and products. We are very keen to offer our own products, which have been made with so much passion and hard work, to the whole world and thus take our traditional Indian Ayurvedic knowledge at a global level. Through Herbal Me, Bindiya dreams of restoring people's&nbsp;faith in the power of mother nature, by delivering the purest part of it in the form of her products.</p>
<h2 contenteditable="true" data-elementor-setting-key="title" data-pen-placeholder="Type Here..." style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>HOW IT ALL STARTED</h2>
<p style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>A great believer in the power of nature, Bindiya always had a keen interest in Ayurveda and natural remedies. She was always experimenting in the kitchen making face packs and oils with natural ingredients, easily available at home. She would buy things from the market, add an exotic ingredient and come up with a totally new product. Till date she is experimenting with new recipes, in search of natural solutions. When results of her experiments started to show on her skin and hair, people got inquisitive to know about her body care regime. As a result, she started giving out samples to her friends and family. This created quite a stir and she built the first set of a dedicated audience. This was also when she decided to take it a notch higher and build it into a full-fledged professionally managed enterprise. A glorious result of that is Herbal Me by H.M. Enterprises.</p>
